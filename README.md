# QUACK NOTES

# ***QUACK!***

*Well, now that's out of the way, on to the details.*


### Quack Notes: Like Quick Notes... but they Quack!
As the tag-line and name might suggest, Quack Notes is a note taking app. Project-4 is the Capstone project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. As such I decided to aim for an achiveable minimum viable product (MVP) and expand it from there. 
My idea for the project came from constantly misplacing physical notes and then getting annoyed when I couldn't find them later. The pun name just happened along the way, fairly early on actually, and by then it was too late, Quack Notes was born.

Having used CSS frameworks in previous projects, I elected not to use any at all. This was because I tend to have specific ideas about what things should look like, or how they should be positioned. Not using frameworks also allowed me to practice my pure CSS skills without having to spend time arguing with a framework and its pre-concived ideas.

#### Planning assets

For those  who want a look behind the curtain at the planning used then this is for you. *Otherwise feel free to scroll down to the next picture.*

I present the initial Trello board that I used to sort out the features into importance and work flow. I find tools like Trello can be something of a trap, if not used properly. You can get stuck trying to make the plan make sense and be pretty, or you can just get on with the work. I have elected to just get on with the work in this project. However during work on [Destinations In Time](https://github.com/BUSAMT/DestinationInTime) it proved to be an invaluable tool for team communication and co-ordination. I look forward to working in another team project like that again.

The other planning tool that I used, not as much as I could have, was a wireframe of the pages style and look. Much in the same vein as with the Trello conundrum above, I simply chose to get on with the work. That decision was made both easier by the fact that I had an idea what I wanted the website to look like. However it was harder to make wireframes right at the start of the process without a better idea of what the final product would include. Again a problem specific to single person development under a time crunch with no specific goal at the outset.

### Future Plans

Quack Notes relies on a database connection and hosting such a site was beyond the scope of the time that was allocated to this initial release. Heroku is the site that is sugested by the staff at GA and I see no reason not to trust them, they have steered us right every time.

Amongst the notes in the pond I had planned to have a drop down sort menu. Within this menu would be options/ function for different paramaters of sorting the notes: 

- Name of title
- Date created
- Date updated
- Length of body text
- Image or not

All of these function would have simply sorted in an ascending or desending manner based on the selected parameter.

A seemigly simple feature that eluded me until it was too late to deal with was a confirmation pop-up or message for deleting a note. 

Something that was supposed to be a part of practicing my pure CSS was making sure the site was properly responsive to mobile design and screen sizes. I think one of the things that I failed to realise earlier on was that just using reactive units, I think that's what they are called, like vmin or rem is not enough to make a website properly responsive. Next time I will aim to address this earlier in the design process, by adhering to mobile-first design philosophies.


#### And to end on a high note...

# ***A Huge Thanks to: Joel Turnbull, Tina Vao, CJ Holt and Niel Tarar!***
### Without these four remarkable instructors I would not have made it through this much course or learnt so much in so little time.

Again, THANK YOU!!! So much, you have all been brilliant.
